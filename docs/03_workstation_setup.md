# Phase 3: The Workstation (Launcher)

The Launcher is the app you actually click to start working.

1. **Download:** On your AYON web dashboard, click the **"Download Launcher"** button in the top right corner.
2. **Install:** Run the installer for your OS (Windows `.exe` or Linux `.zip`).
3. **Connect:** Open the AYON Launcher and enter your server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:5000`) and your login credentials.
