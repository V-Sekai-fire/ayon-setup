# Phase 4: Connecting Blender/Maya

AYON doesn't "find" Blender automatically; you have to point it to the executable.

1. **Path Setup:** In the Web UI, go to **Studio Settings > Applications**.
2. **Executable:** Find "Blender" in the list and paste the path to your `blender.exe` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 4.2\blender.exe`).
3. **Launch:** Restart your desktop Launcher. You should now see the Blender icon. Click it to launch Blender with the AYON "Publish" and "Load" menus pre-loaded.
